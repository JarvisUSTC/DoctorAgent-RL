## Introduction

DoctorAgent-RL is a reinforcement learning-based multi-agent collaborative framework designed to address the critical limitations of current clinical dialogue systems. By modeling medical consultations as dynamic decision-making processes under uncertainty, our framework enables:

1. **Adaptive Information Gathering**: Intelligent adjustment of dialogue paths based on patient responses
2. **Clinical Reasoning Alignment**: Autonomous development of interaction strategies consistent with medical logic
3. **Overcoming Static Paradigms**: Moving beyond superficial pattern imitation in existing dialogue datasets

Through continuous multi-turn interactions between doctor and patient agents optimized via reinforcement learning, DoctorAgent-RL achieves significant improvements in diagnostic accuracy and interaction efficiency.

## Methodology

</div>

Our framework consists of three core components:

1. **Doctor Agent**: Responsible for diagnostic reasoning and question formulation
2. **Patient Agent**: Simulates patient responses based on medical history and symptom progression
3. **Consultation Evaluator**: Provides comprehensive feedback through multi-dimensional reward signals

The reinforcement learning process involves:
1. Multi-turn dialogue simulation between agents
2. Dynamic reward calculation based on consultation quality
3. Policy updates using proximal policy optimization
4. Continuous strategy refinement through iterative interactions
