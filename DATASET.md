# DoctorAgent-RL ðŸš€: Multi-Agent Collaborative Reinforcement Learning for Clinical Dialogue

Our preprocessed training set and test set is located in the `data/` directory. For **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)** cold start, we use the `train_en_8068_all_format_filter_994_sft_w_thinking.parquet` dataset. This dataset was created by prompting DeepSeek-V3 to generate the thinking process for each sample.

For **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** training, we utilize the `train_en_8068_all_format_filter_7k_rl_reward_w_des.parquet` dataset. This dataset includes detailed patient descriptions, which were generated by prompting Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. Notably, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct also serves as our patient agent in the RL setup.

For **Evaluation**, we use the `MTMedDialog.json` as the test set.
